What is your name (last name first)?

	Cain, Cooper

Did you work with a partner? If so, what is your partner's name (last name first)?

	No

Which extra-credit options (if any) did you complete?

	None

If you worked in a partnership, how did you divide up the work of the assignment -- analyzing the specification and/or questioning the teaching staff; setting up a new programming environment such as Java 8 with Eclipse; Implementing the methods for the classes Vertex, Edge, Operator, ExploredGraph, and the search methods dfs, bfs, retrievePath, etc.

	N/A

What did you learn from this assignment? Include concepts such as graph representation by adjacency lists, graph search algorithms, problem-space theory (operators, preconditions, transition functions), combinatorial explosion (size of graph as a function of number of disks, etc.). Also include skills such as programming with Java 8's functional features, teamwork, etc.

	I learned that setting an object to reference another and then changing it will also effect the object that was referenced. Therefore to make a change to the object without changing the original, you have to create a new object that is the same as the original. I also learned that searching through a graph in different ways can give different results even when going from one point to another. For example, the paths resulting from depth first search and breadth first search are different.

If your assignment is late, how do you wish to handle the lateness penalty? (Answer for yourself, not your partner, if you have one.)

	It isn't
